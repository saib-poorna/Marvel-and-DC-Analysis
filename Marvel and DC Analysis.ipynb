    "Welcome to the Final Project!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadlines üìÖ**: This assignment has two deadlines. \n",
    "- The first deadline is **Thursday, November 17th at 11:59PM**. This is a **checkpoint** by which you must submit Sections 0 and 1 of the project. You may not use slip days to extend this deadline. \n",
    "- The second deadline is **Tuesday, November 29th at 11:59PM**, and this is for your completed project submission. You may use up to two slip days to extend this deadline.  If working with a partner and using slip days, slip days will be deducted from each person‚Äôs allocation individually. If one or both partners has run out of slip days and you submit the project late, we will reallocate slip days towards the final project, away from lesser-weighted assignments, [as described in the syllabus](https://dsc10.com/syllabus/#deadlines-and-slip-days). \n",
    "\n",
    "10% of your grade will come from your score on the checkpoint, and 90% of your grade will come from your score on the final submission. See the EdStem post titled \"Final Project Released!\" for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners üëØ**: You are very much encouraged to find a partner to work through the project with. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to **all parts** of the project. Updated [partner guidelines](https://dsc10.com/pair-programming/) are available on the course website. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules üìú**: Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for the final exam and your future in data science. If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support ü§ù**: You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on EdStem, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private EdStem post and course staff will try to respond. All of the concepts necessary for this project were covered in lecture and can be found in the [textbook](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) and [`babypandas` notes](https://notes.dsc10.com). If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section or referencing the Jupyter notebook from lecture will often help clarify the concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests üß™**: The `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch basic mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. Additional tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice ü¶â**: First, **start early**. As you may know from the Midterm Project, projects are complex and time-consuming. Second, develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells, and you can add additional cells as needed. Don't try to do everything in one cell without seeing the intermediate output. In particular, for simulations where you need to do something many times, first just do the process once and make sure the results look reasonable. Then wrap your code inside a `for`-loop to repeat it. Similarly, for defining functions, first write code that will produce the desired output for a single fixed input. Then, once you know it's working, you can put that code inside a function and change the input to be a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Seeds üå±**: This project uses random seeds, as described in [Homework 6](http://datahub.ucsd.edu/user-redirect/git-sync?repo=https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc10-2022-fa&subPath=homeworks/hw06/hw06.ipynb). When we provide a random seed, we set the internal configurations of Python's random number generator so that it produces the same results every time, making it easier to grade your submission. You don't need to understand how random seeds work, just be aware that when you see a call to `np.random.seed`:\n",
    "- Don't change it.\n",
    "- Don't be alarmed if you see the same results each time you run that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Simulations ‚è≥**: If any of your cells are taking more than five minutes to run, you are probably doing something wrong. You can sometimes speed things up by making sure you have a DataFrame of *only* the rows and columns you need to do your analysis, which should be defined outside the for loop of your simulation. When possible, try to avoid using additional `for`-loops and queries inside a simulation, and see if a faster method, like a `numpy` method or `groupby`, could be used instead. If you haven't yet watched the video we provided on when **not** to use `for`-loops, it should be well worth your time."

    "**Question 9.3.** ‚≠ê‚≠ê We're now interested in the probability that a bundle of 5 characters contains a different number of DC characters, not just 2. To do this, rather than writing many different simulations, your job is to write a single simulation that 100,000 times generates a bundle, counts the number of DC characters in that bundle, and stores the result in the array `simulated_dc_counts`. At the end, `simulated_dc_counts` will contain the number of DC characters in many simulated bundles, and you can use it to approximate the probability of a bundle containing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 DC characters.\n",
